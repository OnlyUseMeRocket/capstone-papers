## Papers at a glance

- [Reimplementation of the Classical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Using Modern Computational Tools](NeuralODE.pdf)
  A concise review of Neural ODEs with a proof-of-concept reimplementation, highlighting why continuous-time models help time-series learning and where they trade off against residual networks. Includes an MNIST experiment comparing a Neural ODE model to a standard residual network baseline.
  
  > Keywords: neural ODEs, continuous-time modeling, MNIST, residual networks

- [Parallel Exploration of Reward Functions in Catan using Containerized Deployments](Parallel_Exploration_of_Reward_Functions_in_Catan_using_Containerized_Deployments.pdf)
  Investigates how different reward functions and hyperparameters affect a reinforcement-learning agent playing a two-player Catan variant, while evaluating the benefits and constraints of containerized training workflows. Uses the game’s stochastic mechanics to motivate the learning setup and evaluation.
  
  > Keywords: reinforcement learning, reward shaping, containerization, Catan

- [Pragmatic Approach to CNN Deployment using Modern Tooling](Pragmatic_Approach_to_CNN_Deployment_using_Modern_Tooling.pdf)
  Proposes a self-contained Helm deployment to run object-detection inference and metrics across multiple CNN architectures (Sparse R-CNN, DETR, Faster R-CNN), enabling experimentation in realistic deployment environments rather than notebook-only pipelines.
  Keywords: CNN deployment, Helm, object detection, MLOps

- [Restricted IOD Method using Deep Learning Function Approximation](Restricted_IOD_Method_Using_Deep_Learning_Function_Approximation.pdf)
  Frames initial orbit determination (IOD) as a growing need for space traffic management and explores deep-learning function approximation for restricted-orbit dynamics. Focuses on mapping observation data to orbital state under limited prior knowledge.
  
  > Keywords: initial orbit determination, space traffic management, function approximation, deep learning

- [Deep Learning Methods to IOD (Presentation)](Restricted_IOD_Presentation.pdf)
  Slide-based overview of IOD challenges and a motivating case study on using neural networks to approximate restricted-orbit dynamics, emphasizing how learning-based models can reduce downstream orbit-improvement uncertainty.

  > Keywords: IOD, neural networks, orbital dynamics, space debris

- [A Brief Overview of Structural Health Management and How Emerging GPS Technologies Can Augment the Process](SHM_GPS_Technologies.pdf)
  Surveys structural health monitoring practices, reviews legacy systems, and explains how high-precision GPS can enable millimeter-level measurements for large structures. Discusses current limitations and future research directions for GPS-based monitoring.

  > Keywords: structural health monitoring, GPS, infrastructure, sensing
